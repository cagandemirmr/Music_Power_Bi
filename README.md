# üéµ Music Power BI Analysis Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project involves recreating a previous SQL-based music data analysis using Power BI. By setting up relationships between tables, writing DAX functions, and creating interactive visuals, I optimized the data model and reporting. The main goal of this project was to answer critical business questions and gain insights using key performance indicators (KPIs).

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation and Cleaning

### 1. Data Checking
- Imported the dataset into Power Query Editor.
- **Checked for missing values**, **duplicates**, and **errors** to ensure data integrity.
- Cleaned and transformed the data before loading it into the Power BI model.

### 2. Data Modeling
- Set up a **star schema** to optimize the data structure and relationships.
- Fact and dimension tables were separated to enhance performance and streamline reporting.

## üìä KPI Analysis and Dashboard

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Total Revenue**: Sum of all sales across all channels.
2. **Total Number of Purchases**: Total count of all transactions.
3. **Total Customer Count**: Number of unique customers.

These metrics are essential for evaluating business performance.

![KPIs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f6341f4-07c7-44c3-af41-7eb4a4e922d1)

- **Revenue** data was extracted from the `invoice` table, while **purchase counts** and **customer IDs** were pulled from `invoice_line`.
- Using the `RELATED` DAX function, I connected the `Genre` table to `invoice_line` to analyze revenue by genre.

## üìà Visualizations and Insights

### 1. Top 5 Countries by Total Revenue
- Created a **Tree Map** to visualize the top-performing countries by revenue.

### 2. Distribution of Music Genres
- Used a **Donut Chart** to showcase the distribution of genres.

### 3. Interactive Slicers
- Added slicers to filter data by **Genre** (vertical) and **Date** (dropdown) for enhanced interactivity.

### 6. Top Customers by Purchases
- Created a **Table** to display the top customers by total purchases, using an N filter.

## üìã Pop-up Window Feature
- Added a **pop-up window** for additional insights without cluttering the main dashboard.
- Created shapes with 50-60% transparency for a background effect.
- Used bookmarks to control the appearance of the pop-up.

### Pop-up Interaction
- **Blank button** used to close the pop-up window.
- Grouped all elements to appear as a single pop-up and used bookmarks to toggle visibility.
- Created a button on the main dashboard to trigger the pop-up display.

## üìå Conclusion
This Power BI project allowed me to explore interactive reporting and data visualization techniques effectively. By leveraging DAX functions, slicers, and dynamic visuals, I was able to provide actionable insights for music sales analysis. The pop-up window feature also enhanced the interactivity of the dashboard, making it user-friendly and engaging.

Feel free to explore the dashboard and provide feedback!
